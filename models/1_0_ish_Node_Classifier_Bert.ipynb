Now I am sure it helps that I am a musician, since this created an immediate connection to the subject matter. I spent a portion of the movie with my Telecaster in my lap trying to play along with the characters who all seem to be really playing and singing these songs. However I also am not a fan of country western, so that could have easily been a turn off. To begin describing the action in the film is daunting. I cannot even process a lot of what I saw. This movie is extremely dense, and the first 30 minutes or so are spent just trying to figure out who people are. Their relationships to one another - some of which are purely incidental - slowly become clear as things progress. It is an ensemble cast with no clear lead and lots of overlapping conversations. Some developments all tie together in the end. Some seem to be kind of loose ends. There is throughout, however, a very keen sense about people. These naturalistic performances are believable and so is the world they inhabit. It feels like a film that does not exaggerate - rather, it downplays some of the outrageousness which just makes it seem all the more outrageous. Consider for example Shelley Duvall's wig or Jeff Goldblum's entire character. I feel I should mention this. Jeff Goldblum is in this film. He never speaks, and he is awesome. Nashville is a musical. There is reportedly around an hour of music in its 150+ minute run time. I believe it. Sometimes these songs, most if not all of which are original, seem to speak pointedly to or about a character. Sometimes it is all about the shifts and glances in the audience. There are many memorable scenes, such as when a fragile country starlet spaces out on stage and begins rambling between numbers, or a disenchanted housewife waits at the back of a bar for a womanizing folk singer, or a poor deceived waitress is goaded into a striptease by a raucous crowd and still refuses to believe that she cannot actually sing. This is rich film, a complex tapestry perfectly suited to a moment in time (the US Bicentennial) that seems as though it will reward additional viewings. I sometimes become fidgety during long movies but I was never bored with Nashville. It swept me along with its quirky and interesting characters to a climax that maybe I should have seen coming. 8/10\n",
